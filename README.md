# Recipe Tracker App
 Internal Project for the Internship Class

## Problem Statement
Like many people my family has many recipes and cookbooks that are passed from generation to generation. 
Currently all of these recipes are scattered throughout various cookbooks and it is sometimes difficult to find certain recipes.
The goal of this application is to create an site that allows users to easily store and rate their recipes which will allow them to search for recipes with greater ease than before.
